    "text": "EPPS Coding camp is proposed to provide incoming graduate students a basic coding training to help prepare participants to grasp the fundamental aspects of statistical programming and data management for further developments in different disciplines. It is designed for applications across various disciplines but not to replace domain-specific research method courses.\n\n\nThis camp is designed to equip incoming graduate students from a wide range of disciplines with the essential skills needed in R programming, data management, analysis, and visualization, among others. Over three intensive days, the students will learn the fundamentals of R programming to intermediate skills such as distributed computing, preparing students for the data-driven challenges of in respective fields.\nThe curriculum is inspired by and in some aspects adapted from the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy coding camp, focused on active learning, collaboration (social programming), and computational thinking. This camp is cross-disciplinary in design and aimed at providing students with a solid foundation in data handling and analysis techniques, crucial for your academic and professional growth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorning Session: Introduction to R\n\nOverview of R and RStudio\nInstallation of software\nBasic R syntax and operations\nData types and structures\nBasic operations and functions\n\nAfternoon Session: Package Management\n\nIntroduction to CRAN and GitHub packages\nInstalling and loading packages\nManaging package dependencies\nOverview of essential packages for data science\n\n\nSuggested Reading: - “R for Data Science” by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund, Chapters 1-3\n\n\n\n\nMorning Session: Data Management\n\nReading and writing data\nData cleaning and transformation with dplyr\nTidying data with tidyr\n\nAfternoon Session: Data Analysis & Data Visualization\n\nExploratory data analysis (EDA) techniques\nVisualizations with ggplot2\nBest practices for presenting data\n\n\nSuggested Reading: - “R for Data Science” by Hadley Wickham & Garrett Grolemund, Chapters 5-7, 11-14\n\n\n\n\nMorning Session: Function Writing\n\nWriting custom functions\nDebugging and error handling\nFunctional programming concepts\n\nAfternoon Session: Distributed Computing\n\nIntroduction to parallel and distributed computing with R\nUsing R with big data (overview of SparkR, etc.)\nCase studies and applications\n\n\nSuggested Reading: - “Advanced R” by Hadley Wickham, Chapters on Functions and Functional Programming - “Mastering Spark with R” by Javier Luraschi, Kevin Kuo, Edgar Ruiz (for distributed computing)\n\n\n\n\nAt the end of Day 1, participants will undergo a brief assessment covering the basics of R programming and package management. This assessment will help us determine the appropriate track (standard or intermediate) for each student, ensuring personalized learning experiences that cater to individual skill levels.\nHomework assignments will be designed for different tracks. Students can choose to more challenging intermediate tasks.\n\n\n\nOn the final day, we will review key concepts, discuss how to continue learning and applying these skills in your disciplines, and provide resources for further exploration. Our goal is for students to leave the camp not only with a solid foundation in coding in general but also with the confidence to apply these new skills to research and learning in own fields of study.\nThis plan offers a balanced mix of instruction, practical application, and interactive learning opportunities to cater to the diverse backgrounds and interests of graduate students across various disciplines.
