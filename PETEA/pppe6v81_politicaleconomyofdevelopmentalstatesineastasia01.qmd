## Revisiting the Developmental State Model and Its Transformation

::: incremental
-   The developmental state model is pivotal in explaining the economic growth of East Asia.
-   **Core Thesis**: The state drives economic development with coherent, centralized decision-making and autonomy from social classes.
-   **Notable Scholars**: Johnson (1982), Wade (1990), Amsden (1989), Gerschenkron (1962).
:::

## What is the Developmental State?

::: incremental
-   The model emphasizes the state's role in directing rapid industrialization and economic development.
-   **Components**:
    -   Strong bureaucratic control.
    -   Insulated economic policymaking from societal pressure.
    -   State autonomy from private business interests.
:::

## Existing Studies on Transformation

::: incremental
-   Literature focuses on the **transformation** or **decline** of the developmental state.
-   Key puzzles: Why do some states decline while others adapt or even thrive?
-   Variations: Why has South Korea transitioned, while Singapore has remained relatively unchanged?
:::

## Theoretical Contributions

::: incremental
-   This study argues that transformations are driven by:
    -   **Policy constraints** imposed by economic interest groups.
    -   **Democratic transitions** that influence the political context of policy-making.
-   Three empirical cases: South Korea, Singapore, and Taiwan.
:::

## The Theory: Economic Interests, Democratic Transition, and Policy Constraints

## The Rise of the Developmental State

::: incremental
-   The developmental state arose out of political necessity for elite survival in South Korea, Taiwan, and Singapore in the post-war period.
-   **State formation** involved authoritarian rule, strong economic institutions, and export-led growth.
-   **Industrial Structure**: Characterized by domestic private capital concentration (DPCC), foreign direct investment (FDI), and state-owned enterprises (SOEs).
:::

## The Transformation of Political Foundations

::: incremental
-   As democratic transitions took place, the political foundation of state policymaking changed.
-   **Ruling Elites**: Their decisions regarding democratic concessions or suppression were influenced by their political survival.
-   Democratic transitions led to different outcomes, influenced by economic interests and electoral pressures.
:::

## Economic Development and Democratic Mobilization

::: incremental
-   Economic development often leads to demands for democratic participation.
-   **Middle Class and Working Class**: Key actors pushing for regime transitions.
-   Outcomes depend on the ruling elite's strategic choices in handling democratization demands.
:::

## Emergence of Policy Constraints

::: fragment
### Constraints from Economic Interest Groups
:::

::: incremental
-   As economies grew, powerful interest groups emerged, creating structural constraints on policy-making.
-   These constraints varied by the types of interest groups (business elites, labor unions).
-   **Hypothesis**: The industrial structure of a country determines the level of constraints generated by these interest groups.

### International Trade and Economic Interest Groups
:::

::: incremental
-   International trade influences the formation of societal coalitions to defend their material interests.
-   Three types of societal actors emerge based on trade effects: business, labor, and land-owning actors.
-   Structural constraints result from the interactions between these groups and state policies.
:::

### Different Types of Economic Interest Groups

::: incremental
-   There are six types of economic interest groups that emerge based on industrial structure:
    -   **Business Elites**: Concentrated or dispersed business interests.
    -   **Organized Labor**: Concentrated or dispersed labor interests.
    -   **State-Sector Interests**: State-controlled business and labor interests.
-   Different levels of **DPCC**, **FDI**, and **SOE** ownership determine the influence of these groups.
:::

## The Structure of the Theory

::: incremental
-   The theory integrates the economic interests of ruling elites, democratic transitions, and policy constraints.
-   **Elite Survival**: Drives industrial structure formation and political regime strategies.
-   **Economic Interest Groups**: Shape the policy-making environment and state transformation outcomes.
:::

## Empirical Testing and Case Selection


## Empirical #1: Economic Interest Constraints

::: incremental
-   Tests focus on the relationship between industrial structure and the strength of economic interest groups.
-   South Korea: Strong concentrated business interests and labor unions created significant structural constraints.
-   Taiwan: Dispersed business interests resulted in weaker constraints, with significant changes during the 1990s.
-   Singapore: Non-indigenous business interests and state-managed labor led to non-transforming state policy.
:::

## Empirical #2: Democratic Transition

::: incremental
-   South Korea: A rapid democratic transition occurred in 1987 after a failed 1980 attempt.
-   Taiwan: A longer, more gradual transition, with full democracy emerging in 1996.
-   Singapore: Maintained authoritarian control, with no significant movement towards democracy.

## Conclusion

::: incremental
-   The transformation of developmental states is shaped by:
    -   The emergence of economic interests.
    -   The political strategies of ruling elites.
    -   Democratic transitions that reconfigure policy-making environments.
-   Case studies illustrate how different levels of **DPCC**, **FDI**, and **SOE** ownership influence state transformation outcomes.
