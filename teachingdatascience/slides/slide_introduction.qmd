  - The gap is:
    - between student and faculty in using and understanding AI
    - between the hype and reality of AI
    - between the promise and peril of AI
    - between the potential and the pitfalls of AI
    
## The Goal of the Workshop

  - Social and political scientists are beginning to ask how these AI models can enhance (or disrupt) traditional research workflows and teaching designs. 
  - This introduction provides context for the workshop and previews the modules ahead.
