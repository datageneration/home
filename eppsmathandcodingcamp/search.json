    "text": "EPPS Math and Coding camp is proposed to provide incoming graduate students basic math and coding training to help prepare participants to grasp the fundamental aspects of statistical modeling and programming, and data management for further developments in different disciplines. It is designed for applications across various disciplines but not to replace domain-specific research method courses.\n\n\nThis camp is designed to equip incoming graduate students from a wide range of disciplines with the essential skills needed in mathematical thinking, R/Stata programming, data management, analysis, and visualization, among others. Over five intensive days, the students will brush up algebr and calculus, learn the fundamentals of R/Stata programming to intermediate skills such as linear modeling, distributed computing, preparing students for the data-driven challenges of in respective fields.\nThe curriculum is inspired by and in some aspects adapted from the University of Chicago Harris School of Public Policy coding camp, focused on active learning, collaboration (social programming), and computational thinking. This camp is cross-disciplinary in design and aimed at providing students with a solid foundation in math, data handling and analysis techniques, crucial for your academic and professional growth.\n\n\n\nStandard Track: Aimed at those with less background in math and programming. This track would reinforce fundamental concepts, offer more guided practice, and ensure students grasp the basic problem-solving strategies before moving onto more complex applications.\nIntermediate Track: Designed for students with a stronger foundation in mathematics and some experience in programming. This track would introduce more complex problems, offer less guidance, and expect a quicker assimilation of new concepts, focusing on the optimization of models and advanced computational techniques.\n\n\n\n\nBoth tracks start with the same foundational sessions on Day 1, covering Linear Modeling, Systems of Equations, Nonlinear Equations, and Quadratics.\nAssessment at the End of Day 1:\n\nThe assessment should measure understanding of the day’s material and the ability to apply these concepts in problem-solving scenarios.\nIt could include a mix of multiple-choice questions, short answer problems, and a couple of longer problems that require a step-by-step solution.\nThis would help in determining each student’s track by assessing not just their knowledge, but their approach to problem-solving and logical thinking.\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard Track:\n\nMorning (Algebra Continued):\n\nReview and reinforce concepts from Day 1 with additional practice problems.\nIntroduction to the concept of summation with a focus on its application in statistics.\n\nAfternoon (Introduction to Calculus):\n\nBegin with the basics of derivatives and integrals, emphasizing understanding over memorization.\nUse practical examples to explain how calculus is used in optimization and modeling.\n\n\nIntermediate Track:\n\nMorning (Advanced Algebra and Introduction to Calculus):\n\nA quick review of Day 1 concepts followed by complex problem-solving exercises.\nIntroduction to advanced topics in summation and their use in data analysis and statistics.\n\nAfternoon (Advanced Calculus Topics):\n\nDelve into derivative applications and advanced integration techniques, with an emphasis on computational methods.\nDiscuss optimization problems in greater depth, including those that might be solved using computational tools.\n\n\n\n\n\nStandard Track:\n\nFocus on practical applications of R/Stata for basic data analysis, visualization, and simple model development.\nEmphasize understanding the output and results, ensuring that students can interpret data and perform fundamental analyses correctly.\nGradual introduction to writing functions and distributed computing, with detailed walkthroughs.\n\nIntermediate Track:\n\nIntroduce complex data management strategies, advanced visualization techniques, and statistical modeling.\nExplore function writing in-depth, encouraging students to write efficient, reusable code.\nTackle distributed computing earlier and with more complexity, including hands-on exercises with real-world data sets.\n\nEnd of Camp Assessment:\n\nA final assessment or project that requires students to apply the skills they’ve learned.\nThe project could involve a dataset related to their field of study, where they need to clean, visualize, and model the data using R, applying mathematical concepts where necessary.\nStudents from the intermediate track can be tasked with more complex datasets or be required to optimize their models and code for performance.\n\nThis structure provides a gradual learning curve for the standard track while challenging the intermediate track with faster-paced, in-depth content. The assessments not only serve to place students in the correct track but also to reinforce learning and measure progress throughout the camp.\n\n\n\nOn the final day, we will review key concepts, discuss how to continue learning and applying these skills in your disciplines, and provide resources for further exploration. Our goal is for students to leave the camp not only with a solid foundation in mathematical thinking and computational training in general but also with the confidence to apply these new skills to research and learning in own fields of study.\nThis plan offers a balanced mix of instruction, practical application, and interactive learning opportunities to cater to the diverse backgrounds and interests of graduate students across various disciplines. The suggested readings will provide students further preparations in different disciplines.\nReading list:\nFor a comprehensive coding camp focusing on R/Stata programming and data science, a well-curated list of required texts and additional suggested readings can significantly enhance the learning experience.
