["index.html", "Data Programming Chapter 1 Prerequisites", " Data Programming Karl Ho 2019-05-26 Chapter 1 Prerequisites This course requires no prior experience in programming. Yet, if you have some programming experience (e.g. SPSS, Stata, HTML), it will be helpful. R, Python and JavaScript are all interpreted languages. In other words, the programs do not need compilation but will run in an environment to get the outputs. All packages and accounts are free and supported by open sources. It is recommended students bring their own computers (not mobile device) running MacOS, Linux or Windows operating systems. Recommended software and IDE’s: R (https://cran.r-project.org) RStudio (https://www.rstudio.com) Anaconda 3 (https://www.anaconda.com)* Text editor of own choice (e.g. Atom, Sublime Text, Ultraedit) Recommended websites/accounts: GitHub (https://github.com) RStudio Cloud (*) – Python 3.x only.

Gentzkow and Shapiro (2014) list out some principles for data programming. 2.1 Principle of Programming Automation For replicability (future-proof, for the future you) Version Control Allow evolution and updated edition Use Git and GitHub Directories Organize by functions Keys Index variable (relational) Abstraction KISS (Keep in short and simple) Documentation Comments for communicating to later users Management Collaboration ready 2.2 Functionalities of Data Programs A data program can perform : Documentation of data Importing and exporting data Management of data Visualization of data Data models Sample R Programs: # Create variables composed of random numbers x &lt;-rnorm(50) y = rnorm(x) # Plot the points in the plane plot(x, y) # Plot better, using the ggplot2 package ## Prerequisite: install and load the ggplot2 package ## install.packages(&quot;ggplot2&quot;) library(ggplot2) qplot(x,y) # Plot better better with ggplot2 ggplot(,aes(x,y)) + theme_bw() + geom_point(col=&quot;blue&quot;) Sample Python Programs (## represents output) # Import a text file in csv format import pandas as pd CO2 = pd.read_csv(&quot;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kho777/data-visualization/master/data/CO2.csv&quot;) # Take a glimpse of the data file CO2.head() ## country CO2 _kt CO2pc CO2percent ## 0 Australia 446,348 18.6 1.23% ## 1 United States 5,172,336 16.1 14.26% ## 2 Saudi Arabia 505,565 16.0 1.39% ## 3 Canada 555,401 15.5 1.53% ## 4 Russia 1,760,895 12.3 4.86% # Using matplotlib to do a simple plot import matplotlib.pyplot as plt CO2pc=CO2[&quot;CO2pc&quot;] plt.plot(CO2pc) In the following chapters, sample programs will be provided to illustrate these functionalities.

The R statistical programming language is a free, open source package based on the S language developed by John Chambers. 3.1.1 Some history of R and S S was further developed into R by Robert Gentlemen (Canada) and Ross Ihaka (New Zealand) Figure 3.1: R Inventors Source: Nick Thieme. 2018. R Generation: 25 years of R 3.1.2 It is: Large, probably one of the largest based on the user-written add-ons/procedures Object-oriented Interactive Multiplatform: Windows, Mac, Linux According to John Chambers (2009), six facets of R: an interface to computational procedures of many kinds; interactive, hands-on in real time; functional in its model of programming; object-oriented, “everything is an object”; modular, built from standardized pieces; and, collaborative, a world-wide, open-source effort.
