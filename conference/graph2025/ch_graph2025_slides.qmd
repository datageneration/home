## Motivation

-   What characterizes the process of democratic backsliding in Hong Kong and Nicaragua?

-   How do state-led actions undermine democratic institutions in these contexts?

-   What can differences in democratic decline (speed) reveal about potential regime trajectories?

-   Which and why did Civil Society and its constituent organizations get caught up in both of these cases?

-   How about economic and social consequences?

## Introduction: Comparing Hong Kong and Nicaragua in perspective

| Category | Hong Kong | Nicaragua |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Regime Type Before Decline** | Semi-autonomous under PRC ("Birdcage Democracy") | Hybrid regime transitioning from democracy |
| **Protest Trigger Events** | 2019 Anti-Extradition Bill | 2018 INSS pension reform decree |
| **Main Civil Society Targets** | Pro-democracy NGOs, student groups, media | NGOs, universities, Catholic Church |
| **Legal Instruments Used** | National Security Law (2020) | Foreign Agents Law (2020), Cybercrime Law |
| **Repression Style** | Legalistic + selective arrests | Violent crackdowns + judicial persecution |
| **International Response** | Sanctions, condemnations, limited action | OAS & human rights outcry, sanctions |

## Targeted organizations: Hong Kong

-   Potential to mobilize public support (just like to the Great Firewall of China, see King, Pan & Roberts, 2017)
    -   Organizations focused on preserving public memory of anti-government protests
    -   Pro-democracy media outlets and newspapers
    -   Activists involved in pro-democracy organizations overseas
        -   foreign provisions
        -   Hong Kong intelligence officers’ attempted break-in in the United Kingdom

## Impact on Civil Society: Hong Kong

## The case of Nicaragua’s Democratic Backsliding

-   Democratization after the Somoza Regime
-   Daniel Ortega first democratically elected president
-   Return to power in 2006
-   Steady undermining of domestic institutions

## Nicaragua’s democratic decline under Ortega

## 2018 Protests

-   April 2018 protests in response to unpopular social security reforms
-   Government responded with lethal force
-   Protests evolve into broader movement against regime
-   Government attributes protests to foreign interference, particularly NGOs

## Impact on Civil Society: Nicaragua

## Different Paths to Democratic Decline

| Dimension | Hong Kong | Nicaragua |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|
| **Speed of Decline** | Gradual (1997–2020, rapid post-2020) | Abrupt (sharp turn after 2018) |
| **External vs. Internal** | Externally imposed from PRC | Internally driven by Ortega's consolidation |
| **Use of Electoral Reform** | Beijing-controlled system overhaul including disqualfiying candidates | Rigged elections; opposition disqualified |
| **NGO Treatment** | Disbandment & asset freezing | Mass revocations & raids |
| **Media Suppression** | Closure of pro-democracy outlets (e.g. Apple Daily)| State media monopoly & journalist exile |
| **Extraterritorial Reach** | Yes (global warrants, diaspora targeting) | No (repression mostly domestic) |

## Takeaways: Key features of democratic decline

1.	Incremental nature: Unlike traditional coups, democratic backsliding occurs slowly through a series of seemingly legal actions.
2.	Internal subversion: Elected officials, often from the executive branch, dismantle democratic institutions from within.
3.	Maintenance of democratic façade: While eroding democratic substance, leaders often maintain a veneer of democracy, including holding elections

## Mechanims of Democratic Decline (Diamond 2022)

- De-institionalization
  - Judicial independence weakened
  - Suppression of opposition 
    - parties
    - civil society
    - media

- Rule of law erosioN
  - Legal system used to target opposition
  - Selective enforcement of laws
  
- Slide into Authoritarianism
  - Gradual erosion of democratic norms
  - Consolidation of power in the executive
  - Curtailment of civil liberties
