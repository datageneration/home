# National Security Deference or National Security Domination? The “Glory to Hong Kong” Injunction Saga and Hong Kong’s Compromised Judiciary


## Key Points & Findings

::: {.incremental}
- Hong Kong government's unprecedented injunction attempt against "Glory to Hong Kong."
- Court of First Instance initially rejects injunction—rare judicial resistance under NSL.
- Court of Appeal reverses decision, emphasizing national security over free expression.
- Judiciary shows alignment with executive, raising concerns over judicial independence.
- Precedent: 
  - Judicial activism
  - Legal transplantation
  - Broader internet censorship in Hong Kong.
:::

## Judicial Independence under NSL: What is Jurisprudence in brackish water?

::: {.incremental}
- British trained judges operate under heavy political pressure and oversight from Beijing.
- Judiciary adopts cautious, often *deferential* stance to avoid conflict with authorities.
- National security cases rarely challenge executive assertions, limiting independent judgment.
- Government uses legal actions as performative gestures to demonstrate loyalty to Beijing.
- Occasional judicial resistance quickly neutralized by appellate courts.
- Noteworthy case: Chow Hang-tung
:::

## Comparativist: HK vs. China vs. the West

::: {.incremental}
- Court of Appeal misuses comparative jurisprudence to justify censorship.
- Selective and inappropriate invocation of UK national security precedents.
- Judiciary largely sidesteps rigorous analysis of free speech protections.
- Human rights subordinated to broadly defined and unchecked security claims.
- Erosion of Hong Kong’s constitutional autonomy under "One Country, Two Systems.": greatly challenged.
:::



## Future Research Suggestions

::: {.incremental}
- How to conduct empirical studies of NSL's judicial application and censorship effects?
- Cross-subfield Comparative research: Jurisprudence discourse for legal scholars and comparativists
- Collaborate with diasporic and exiled Hong Kong scholars to ensure independent scholarship.
- Data: documentation and critical analysis of ongoing changes in Hong Kong’s legal system.
- Build international research networks focused on human rights and rule of law challenges.

# "Voice After Exit: Diaspora, Transnational Linked Fate, and Homeland-Related Policy"
 

## Key Points & Findings

::: {.incremental}
- How diasporas form political preferences through **transnational linked fate**.
- Key concepts: 
  - Pre-migration experiences 
  - Longstanding homeland ties
  - Special group identity
- Data and methods: conjoint experiments among Hong Kong diasporas in the US, UK, Canada, and Australia.
- Homeland-related issues—especially hawkish stances toward China—dominate political decision making over domestic issues.
- Contributions: 
  - Novel empirical insights with new data and design
  - Theory contribution:Diasporas navigate trade-offs between foreign and domestic policy preferences.
:::

## Analysis & Discussion (1)

::: {.incremental}
- **Conceptual Extension:** Extends Hirschman’s *Exit, Voice, and Loyalty* framework by introducing *transnational linked fate* to explain diasporic identity formation.
- **Identity and Politics:** Demonstrates that diasporas maintain strong bonds with their homeland despite varying levels of host country integration (most simiar system design?).
- **Foreign vs. Domestic:** When confronted with salient domestic issues (e.g., healthcare, economy), diasporas prioritize homeland-related policies?
:::

## Analysis & Discussion (2)

::: {.incremental}
- **Pre-migration Influence:** Lasting impact of pre-migration political socialization on post-migration policy preferences.
- **Comparative Strength:** Cross-national data show consistent prioritization of foreign policy preferences across diverse host countries.
- **Theoretical Contribution:** Challenges traditional minority politics by highlighting the transnational dimension that goes beyond racial or ethnic categorizations: unique for Hongkongers?.
- **Electoral Implications:** Suggests that diasporic voting behavior in host country elections may be strongly driven by geopolitical concerns tied to their homeland.
:::

## Recommendations & Future Research

::: {.incremental}
- **Innovations:** New data and design: great design for Hirschman’s thesis with Hong Kong data .
- **Comparative and beyond** How *transnational linked fate* concept compares across different diasporas groups such as Mexicans (Medina Vindal 2017)
- **Qualitative Approaches:** Complement survey experiments with in-depth interviews to uncover the mechanisms behind diaspora prioritization.
- **Policy Implications:** Further explore how diasporic preferences influence host country electoral outcomes and foreign policy decisions.
- **Interdisciplinary Collaboration:** Research partnerships among political scientists, sociologists, and migration scholars to deepen theoretical and empirical insights.

# "Mobilizing Support for Protests: Non-violent Framing Sites in the 2019 Hong Kong Local Elections" 

## Key Points & Findings

::: {.incremental}
- Non-violent protest framing via “Lennon Walls” (public protest posters) influences voter behavior?
- Hypothesis: occupying public space with these posters mobilizes support for pro-democracy candidates.
- Data and methods: electoral data from 452 constituencies to compare vote shares in areas with and without Lennon Walls |OLS and 2SLS regression models, controlling for demographics, past electoral performance, and spatial factors.
- Findings: constituencies with Lennon Walls exhibit a significantly higher pro-democracy vote share.
- Takeaway: non-violent framing coexists with radical protest tactics to sustain public support despite repression.
:::

## Analysis & Discussion (1)

::: {.incremental}
- **Framing Effect:** Visible presence of Lennon Walls creates a favorable political narrative, enhancing the viability of pro-democracy candidates.
- **Methodological Rigor:** Robust statistical analyses (OLS, 2SLS) control for confounding factors and use innovative geospatial measures (e.g., travel time polygons, distance metrics).
- **Key theory proposition** The study challenges the notion that violent and non-violent tactics are mutually exclusive; non-violent framing can complement more radical protest actions.
- **Contamination Issue:** Vicinity and spatial correlations: voters may be inadvertently exposed to protest messaging outside fixed boundaries, potentially diluting the treatment effect | How to single out?
:::

## Analysis & Discussion (2)

::: {.incremental}
- **Electoral Mobilization:** The strategic placement of Lennon Walls appears to shift political opportunity structures, making pro-democracy candidates seem more competitive.
- **Visual Politics:** The study underscores the power of visual protest cues in shaping public opinion and mobilizing voter turnout.
- **Theoretical Contribution:** Contributes to debates on radical flank effects and protest framing by showing that non-violent public displays can positively impact electoral outcomes | Unique in Hong Kong context?  Protest/civil movement literature in other contexts?
- **Limitations:** The spatial diffusion of protest messages and potential non-compliance in control areas complicate the isolation of the pure treatment effect.
:::

## Recommendations & Future Research

::: {.incremental}
- **Granular Spatial Analysis:** Use high-resolution geospatial data to more precisely gauge voter exposure to Lennon Walls.
- **Mixed Methods:** Complement quantitative findings with case studies (e.g. interviews) to better understand voter perceptions of non-violent protest framing.
- **Comparative Research:** Extend the analysis to other protest contexts (e.g., Gezi Park (Turkey)) to assess the generalizability of the non-violent framing effect.
