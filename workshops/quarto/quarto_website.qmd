# Website Structure in Quarto

A Quarto website is a **project**:

```
my-website/
  index.qmd
  about.qmd
  research.qmd
  cv.pdf
  styles.css
  _quarto.yml
```

---

# Role of `_quarto.yml`

- Defines the project type  
- Controls navigation and page layout  
- Sets website options  
- Defines HTML/PDF outputs  
- Custom themes and assets  

---

# Basic Website Configuration

```yaml
project:
  type: website

website:
  title: "My Quarto Website"
  navbar:
    left:
      - text: "Home"
        href: index.qmd
      - text: "About"
        href: about.qmd
      - text: "Research"
        href: research.qmd
      - text: "CV"
        href: cv.pdf

format:
  html:
    theme: cosmo
  pdf:
    toc: true
```

---

# Pages as `.qmd` Files

Each page begins with YAML:

```markdown
---
title: "About Me"
---

# About

I am a researcher working in...
```

Quarto automatically converts them to HTML.

---

# Adding Navigation Dropdowns

```yaml
navbar:
  left:
    - text: "Research"
      menu:
        - text: "Publications"
          href: pubs.qmd
        - text: "Projects"
          href: projects.qmd
        - text: "Datasets"
          href: data.qmd
```

Dropdown menus support hierarchical organization.

---

# Sidebar Navigation (Alternative)

```yaml
sidebar:
  style: docked
  search: true
  contents:
    - index.qmd
    - about.qmd
    - teaching.qmd
    - pubs.qmd
```

Ideal for course or documentation websites.

---

# Themes

- Bootswatch themes  
- Example: `cosmo`, `flatly`, `minty`, `darkly`, `journal`, `litera`  
- Custom CSS/SCSS allowed  

```yaml

```

---

# Custom CSS Example

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: quarto-dev/quarto-actions/publish@v2
        with:
          target: gh-pages
```

---

# Verify Deployment

Check under:

1. GitHub → Actions → "build-deploy"  
2. GitHub → Settings → Pages (green checkmark)  

---

# Website URL

Most common URL:

```
https://USERNAME.github.io/REPO-NAME/
```

Ensure repository is public unless using paid GitHub features.

---

# Updating the Website

```
git add .
git commit -m "Update content"
git push
```

GitHub Actions automatically redeploys.

---

# Exercise 1: Build Website Structure

- Traceability  
- Archiving  

These principles support academic integrity and methodological rigor.
